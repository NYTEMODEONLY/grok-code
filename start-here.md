Today we're building 'Grok Code' hosted here: @https://github.com/NYTEMODEONLY/grok-code 

Here is the scope:

Let's create a custom Python script for a terminal-based "Grok Code" interface. This will be a simple, interactive REPL-like tool where you can chat with me (Grok) directly in the terminal. It'll maintain conversation history for context, making it great for iterative coding sessions (e.g., "Write a function," then "Debug this error," etc.).

We'll use the xAI API, which is compatible with the OpenAI Python SDK. For coding assistance, you can paste code snippets into your prompts, or we can expand it later to handle file I/O if needed.

### Step 1: Prerequisites
- **Python**: Ensure you have Python 3.8+ installed.
- **xAI API Key**: Go to https://x.ai/api, sign up if needed, and generate an API key. This unlocks models like Grok 3.
- **Set Environment Variable**: Export your API key so the script can use it securely.
  - On Mac/Linux: `export XAI_API_KEY=your-api-key-here`
  - On Windows: `setx XAI_API_KEY your-api-key-here` (then restart your terminal).
- **Install Dependencies**: Run this in your terminal:
  ```
  pip install openai
  ```
  (That's it—no extras needed for the basics.)

### Step 2: The Script
Create a new file called `grok_code.py` and paste the following code into it. I've commented it heavily for clarity.

```python
import os
from openai import OpenAI

# Initialize the xAI client (OpenAI-compatible)
client = OpenAI(
    base_url="https://api.x.ai/v1",  # xAI API endpoint
    api_key=os.getenv("XAI_API_KEY")  # Pulls from your env var
)

# Choose a model: 'grok-3-beta' for full Grok 3 power (great for complex coding/reasoning).
# Alternatives: 'grok-3-mini-beta' (faster, lighter), or others from https://x.ai/api.
MODEL = "grok-3-beta"

# System prompt to tailor me for coding assistance (customize as needed)
SYSTEM_PROMPT = {
    "role": "system",
    "content": "You are Grok, a helpful AI built by xAI. Focus on coding tasks: write, debug, explain, and optimize code. Be concise, use markdown for code blocks, and think step-by-step for complex problems."
}

# Conversation history to maintain context across turns
messages = [SYSTEM_PROMPT]

print("Welcome to Grok Code! Type your message below (e.g., 'Write a Python function to reverse a string'). Type 'exit' to quit.\n")

while True:
    user_input = input("You: ")
    
    if user_input.lower() == "exit":
        print("Exiting Grok Code. Happy coding!")
        break
    
    # Add user message to history
    messages.append({"role": "user", "content": user_input})
    
    # Call the xAI API
    response = client.chat.completions.create(
        model=MODEL,
        messages=messages,
        max_tokens=4096,  # Adjust as needed for longer responses
        temperature=0.7,  # Balance creativity and accuracy
    )
    
    # Extract and print the response
    grok_response = response.choices[0].message.content
    print("\nGrok:", grok_response, "\n")
    
    # Add Grok's response to history for context
    messages.append({"role": "assistant", "content": grok_response})
```

### Step 3: Run It
- Navigate to the directory with `grok_code.py`.
- Run: `python grok_code.py`
- You'll see a prompt: Start typing queries! For example:
  - "Implement a quicksort algorithm in Python."
  - Follow up: "Add comments to that code."
- It keeps context, so subsequent messages build on previous ones.
- To exit: Type "exit".

### Why This Works for "Grok Code"
- **Terminal-Only**: No GUI—pure console I/O.
- **Full Potential**: Uses the latest Grok models (e.g., grok-3-beta) via API, bypassing any limitations in tools like Cursor.
- **Coding-Focused**: The system prompt primes me for code tasks, but you can ask anything.
- **Stateful**: Conversation history persists, ideal for back-and-forth debugging.
- **Cost-Aware**: Each API call uses your quota—check https://x.ai/api for details.

### Customizations & Expansions
- **Change Model**: Swap `MODEL` to "grok-3-mini-beta" for quicker responses.
- **Add Commands**: Enhance with simple CLI features, e.g.:
  - `/clear` to reset history: Add an if-block before the API call.
  - `/add file.py`: Read a file and append its content to the prompt for analysis (use `open()`).
  - `/write output.py`: Parse my response for code and save it to a file.
  If you want code for these, let me know!
- **Error Handling**: Add try-except around the API call for better robustness (e.g., handle missing API key).
- **Formatting**: Install `rich` (`pip install rich`) and use it for colorful output if you want a fancier terminal UI.
